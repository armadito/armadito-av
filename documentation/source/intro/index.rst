Introduction
============

**Armadito Antivirus** is an open-source antivirus that protects your computers and servers from malwares and viruses. It includes classical signature-based malware detection and provides innovative heuristic detection modules for binaries (MS-Windows and GNU/Linux) and for PDF documents.

This project is designed in a way which allows anyone to improve anti-malware techniques' state of the art. 
For example, security experts are able to concentrate on anti-malwares techniques only by developing their own modules in C language.
This plugin system aims to encourage people to test and develop experimental techniques freely.

An intuitive and user-friendly interface gives access to all Armadito’s features: on-demand scanning, real-time protection, quarantine zone, threat detection journal, etc. This interface has been developed using recent `NW.js <http://nwjs.io//>`_ technology. Consequently, this graphical user interface aims to be multi-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X).
